Hi! My name is Sean Sangwoo Nam and I'm a fourth year computer science student at UC San Diego, graduating December 2019.

I love learning and using new technologies to build products and services that solve problems or are just really cool to share. I've worked with a variety of different languages, frameworks, and libraries.

You can find out more about my experience by reading my [Resume](/resume/).

- [LinkedIn](https://bit.ly/snam-li)  

You can reach me at *sangwoo* @ this website OR *namsangwoo1* @ google's email service
