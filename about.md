Hi! My name is Sean Sangwoo Nam and I'm a third year computer science student at UC San Diego.

Sean Nam, born Sangwoo Nam, is a computer science major at the University of California, San Diego. Born in Seoul, South Korea, he grew up in a small town in Missouri, attended international school in Seoul, and then completed high school in southern California.

Sean has always been fascinated by technology and its impact. When he is not working on new software projects or mastering a new skill, he is on his phone checking out the newest apps, on the web reading about the latest startups, or planning his next trip.

While he likes being a jack of all trades, Seanâ€™s focus has been iOS apps. He is branching into other areas, like game development and advanced full-stack web programming, and into how fields such as data science and artificial intelligence.
