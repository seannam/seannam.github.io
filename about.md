Hi! My name is Sean Sangwoo Nam and I'm a third year computer science student at UC San Diego.

I love learning and using new technologies to build products and services. I've worked with a variety of different languages, frameworks, and libraries.

You can find out more about my experience by reading my [Resume](/resume/).
