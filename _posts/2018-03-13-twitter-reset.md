I'll be the first to admit it, I'm not a big fan of social media. Compared to my peers, you could even say I'm not addicted to Facebook, Reddit, Instagram, or Twitter. But today I decided to unfollow everyone and only follow a select few. I was inspired by Jason Zook's Twitter experiment, which you can read about [here](https://jasondoesstuff.com/unfollowing-twitter-experiment/).  

I started off following almost a 1000 people and after a couple hours of cleaning, I am down to just 56 people.  

A few things I noticed:  
1. I was following at least 13 VC's or VC firms
2. At least 46 people claimed "founder" or "co-founder" status and 12 claimed "CEO" status
3. At least 12 claimed they were "entrepreneurs"
4. Most were developers, product/service brand accounts, or involved in the start up "industry"

Notes on my observations.
1. Not surprising as I've been following startups and VC's for years.  
2. I say *at least* because after a while I stopped saving people into what ended up being 39 lists. Also, these lists are more like tags in that people could be in multiple lists so there is some discrepancy. 
3. I have so much to say about this mostly because I dislike and disagree with how the media portrays startups and entrepreneurship. But regardless, it's not surprising that entrepreneurs would be on Twitter and that I would follow them.
4. Not surprising at all. As a C.S. major, I do a lot of programming not to mention that *software engineer* is one of the most common career paths for this major.

My goal was to:
1. Follow people that actually talk and interact with others, not just promote their own work or sell their products/services,
2. Ignore "high profile" accounts, CEOs of major companies. I can find them anytime if I am looking for them specificially.
3. Follow people not brands/company accounts. 
4. Follow people active in the past month, and
5. Follow makers, because I like trying new things.

All in all, I think I did a decent job. It's not 20, the number of people [@jasondoesstuff](https://twitter.com/jasondoesstuff) or other people have but it feels much better than the nearly thousand people I was following before. I still follow a few inactive accounts and a couple brands/companies, but I am satisfied with my new list.
