I had Jekyll installed and setup back in December 2017 but I didn't use it. Came back today and had to disable `rbenv` and reinstall a bunch of gems to get it to work. 

Basically, setting up Jekyll was a pain and I wonder if it was worth it. 

You don't realize how convenient and easy Wordpress really is until you try to move away from it.
